    **If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.**

    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

    - **Consent.** We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.
    - **Performance of a Contract.** We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
    - **Legitimate Interests.** We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:

    - **Vital Interests.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

    **If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.**

    We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.

    In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:

    - If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
    - For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
    - For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
    - If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
    - For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
    - If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
    - If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
    - If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
    - If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
    - If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes

    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ( "DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized .

We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

    We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
